# Page Fault Simulator

The objectives of this programming project are:

Understanding how demand paging enables multiple processes to run concurrently on the same system while using more memory than what is available.

Implementing a page fault simulator that characterizes the number of page faults and the number of disk accesses of a certain process simulation.

Writing high-quality C code by following established industry standards.
